## What is Streamlit
- Streamlit is a Python library that allows you to create and share beautiful data apps in minutes without writing any frontend code. It connects directly to your data science code and generates a web UI automatically.
- Pure Python Syntax: You write your app exactly like a standard Python script. Streamlit converts your code into a responsive web interface automatically.
- Interactive Widgets: Easily add sliders (st.slider), buttons (st.button), text inputs (st.text_input), and file uploaders (st.file_uploader) to your app with single lines of code.
- To run the streamlit app, use the command: streamlit run chartbot.py
